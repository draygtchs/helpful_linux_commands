These are my notes for myself for connecting to gihub headlessly. 
I do this when I set up a headless raspberry pi with the desktop disabled.

Raspberry Pi Setup
When you install the os on the rpi microsd card using the rpi imager choose the advanced options. 
There you can enter the wifi information, so the pi will be ready to ssh when it first boots.
You need to: toggle SSH, enter the wifi, wifi password, wifi country...
