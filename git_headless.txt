These are my notes for myself for connecting to gihub headlessly. 
I do this when I set up a headless raspberry pi with the desktop disabled.

After connected to the pi, you will need to do several things:
- create the repo on github.com and include a README.md
- on pi set global user email and user name
- generate ssh keys on the pi
- add ssh public key to github SSH and GPG keys list
- initiate git in the directory on the pi *set the branch to 'main'*
- set remote origin
- git add > git commit > git push

Create the repo on github.com
I would definitely create the repo on github.com first 
and check the box to include a README.md, even if you don't need it.
It is difficult to create a repo from the terminal, and pretty simple on github.com.
Adding the README.md helps several aspects, and it creates the project with a file.
If you start a project without a file, when you push you will have changes to the repo.
Having changes when you push helps git and github to have changes to update.
